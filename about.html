              <h2>About Us</h2>
              <p>It all started in a dream. Mr. Alan, the CEO of CozyCup Cafe, is passionate about computers, coffee, and capybaras. He was always enthusiastic about brewing coffee that would keep him awake at night while working on coding projects. Then, he started selling coffee from food trucks.</p>
              <p>He reached his goals and had the luck to establish a concrete physical store. Now, the cafe is integrated with his idea of having capybaras accompany coffee lovers. This sets the mood for clients to come back even more.</p>
